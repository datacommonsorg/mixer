# Ingress routes external traffic into the cluster by creating
# GCP loadbalancers. Mixer ingress routes requests according to urls.
#
# Note:
# Ingress is not release specific.
# If an ingress already exists, it will overwrite the old one
# with the new routes. Please be extra careful when creating
# an ingress, because the loadbalancers are bound to IPs, which
# are bound to DNS names.
# TODO(alex): Support ingress per release.
