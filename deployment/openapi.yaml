    # Overview
    Data Commons makes it easy to integrate data from its knowledge graph to your web application through a RESTful API. This guide explains how to get started with the API, describes each of the available resources, and provides example code.

    The API of DataCommons is a Web API with a base url of:

    [$ curl http://api.datacommons.org/](http://api.datacommos.org/)

    This base URL, referred to here as API root, exposes a list of the URLs required to access each of three resource types including:
    * **/query**: implements access through a graph query language such as SPARQL.
    * **/node**: implements direct access to nodes or collections of nodes in the KG.
    * **/bulk**: implements bulk access to large subgraphs in the kg (i.e. get all populations, observations, KML texts, etc.).

    Each resource type is accessible via the HTTP GET or POST method.

    # Data Models

    In this section, we will introduce how Data Commons stores data in its open knowledge graph.

    ### Important Terms

    | Term            | Description                                               |
    | :-------------- |:----------------------------------------------------------|
    | Knowledge Graph | The graph structure storing all data in Data Commons.     |
    | Node            | The representation of an entity in the knowledge graph.   |
    | DCID            | The unique identifier assigned to each node in the Data Commons knowledge graph. Short for Data Commons Identifier. |
    | Type            | The class describing a node. For example, the node for "California" has type "State". |
    | Property        | The relation that associates two nodes together.          |
    | Property Label  | Another name for *property*.                              |
    | Property Value  | The set of nodes adjacent to a given node along edges of a given *property*. |
    | Triple          | A compact representation of a statement in the Data Commons knowledge graph of the form (subject, property, object)     |


    ### Overview of the Graph

    Data Commons organizes its data as an open access *knowledge graph*. It contains
    statements about real world objects such as

    - ["Alameda County"](https://browser.datacommons.org/kg?dcid=geoId/06001) is contained in the State of ["California"](https://browser.datacommons.org/kg?dcid=geoId/06).
    - The latitude of
      ["Berkeley"](https://browser.datacommons.org/kg?dcid=geoId/0606000), CA is 37.8703
    - The [population of all persons in Maryland](https://browser.datacommons.org/kg?dcid=dc/o/6w1c9qk7hxjch) has a total count of 5,996,080.

    [Entities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity) such as "Alameda County", "California", and "Berkeley" are represented as **nodes** in the Data Commons
    knowledge graph. There are two important details about a node

    1.  Every node is uniquely identified by a **dcid** which is short for Data
        Commons Identifier. The dcid identifying "California" is `geoId/06`
    2.  Every node has a **class** that broadly describes the category of entities
        that it is an instance of. For example, "California" has type
        [State](https://browser.datacommons.org/kg?dcid=State).

    Relations between entities are represented as a directed edge between two nodes
    in the graph. These relations are called **properties** or **property labels**.
    A portion of the Data Commons graph capturing the statement

      `Alameda County is contained in the California`

    can thus be visualized as the following:

    ![image](https://storage.googleapis.com/notebook-resources/image-1.png)

    Here "Alameda County" and "California" are nodes while
    ["containedInPlace"](https://browser.datacommons.org/kg?dcid=containedInPlace)
    is a property denoting that the node adjacent to the tail of the edge is
    contained in the node adjacent to the head.

    ### Property Values

    When accessing nodes in the graph, it is often useful to describe a set of nodes
    adjacent to a given node. One may wish to query for all cities that are
    contained in a certain county, ask for all schools within a school district,
    etc. Given a node and a property, we denote the **property value** as the set
    of all nodes that are adjacent to the given node along an edge labeled by the
    given property.

    For example, the following are a few property values of "Alameda County"
    along the property "containedInPlace".

    - [California](https://browser.datacommons.org/kg?dcid=geoId/06)
    - [Berkeley](https://browser.datacommons.org/kg?dcid=geoId/0606000)
    - [Oakland](https://browser.datacommons.org/kg?dcid=geoId/0653000)
    - [Emeryville](https://browser.datacommons.org/kg?dcid=geoId/0622594)

    The graph around Alameda County looks like the following.

    ![image](https://storage.googleapis.com/notebook-resources/readthedocs-image-2.png)

    An important thing to note is that direction matters! Berkeley is certainly
    contained in Alameda County, but California is *not* contained in Alameda
    County. Alameda County is contained in California, but it is *not* contained
    in Berkeley!

    When asking for property values one may thus wish to distinguish by the
    *orientation* or direction of the edge. The property values of "Alameda County"
    along *outgoing* edges labeled by "containedInPlace" includes California while
    property values along *incoming* edges include Berkeley, Oakland, and
    Emeryville.

    ### Triples

    Relations in the graph can be compactly described in the format of a **triple**.
    Triples are 3-tuples that take the form `(subject, property, object)`.

    - The *subject* and *object* are two nodes in the Data Commons graph.
    - The *property* is the property labeling the edge oriented from subject to
      object.

    The statement "Alameda County is contained in the California" can be represented
    as a triple of the following form

      ("Alameda County", "containedInPlace", "California")

    Indeed, one could represent the entire Data Commons graph as a collection of
    triples.

    ### More Information

    Data Commons leverages the [Schema.org](https://schema.org) vocabulary to
    provide a common set of types and properties. The Data Model used by Data
    Commons also closely resembles the Schema.org data model. One may refer to
    documentation on the [Schema.org data model](#section/Data Models) to learn more.


    # Authentication

    Using the Data Commons Python API requires you to provision an API key on GCP. Follow these steps to create your own key.

    1. Start by creating a [GCP Project](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/projectcreate?debugUI=DEVELOPERS) and [enabling billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#enable_billing_for_a_project) for that project.
    2. After creating your project, you can navigate to the GCP Console to create an API key.
      - Begin by navigating to **APIs & Services > Credentials** in the side bar or by clicking on [this link](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/apis/credentials?debugUI=DEVELOPERS)
      - Click **Create Credentials** then select **API Key**
      Once you do this, you’ll be presented a key that you can copy to your clipboard.
    3. Enable the Data Commons API on GCP
      - Navigate to the `Data Commons API` in the Google APIs Console.
      - Click the `Enable` button and wait for the process to complete.
    4. Use the API key as a url parameter like **&key=<API_KEY>**

      An example API path would be http://api.datacommons.org/node/triples?dcids=geoId/06&key=API_KEY
