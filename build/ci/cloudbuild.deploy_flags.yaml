# Deploy feature flags
#
# This Cloud Build configuration deploys feature flags to Kubernetes clusters.
# It uses the deploy_flags.sh script to apply ConfigMaps.
# The new values take effect after pods are restarted, e.g. by Reloader.
#
# An environment can be specified via the _ENV substitution. If _ENV is not
# provided, the script will deploy flags for all environments it finds in the
# config directory.

steps:
  # Validate feature flag yaml files
