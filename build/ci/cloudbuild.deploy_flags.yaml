# Deploy feature flags
#
# This Cloud Build configuration deploys feature flags to Kubernetes clusters.
# It uses the deploy_flags.sh script to apply ConfigMaps.
# The new values take effect after pods are restarted, e.g. by Reloader.
#
# An environment can be specified via the _ENV substitution. If _ENV is not
# provided, the script will deploy flags for all environments it finds in the
# config directory.

steps:
  # Ensure past commits are available so they can be used for validation
  - name: gcr.io/cloud-builders/git
    args: ["fetch", "--unshallow"]

  # Run the flag deploy script
  - name: gcr.io/datcom-ci/full-env:${_FULL_ENV_VERSION}
    entrypoint: "bash"
    args:
      - "-c"

        ./deploy/featureflags/deploy_flags.sh deploy/featureflags "$_ENV"
    waitFor: ["validate-feature-flags"]
